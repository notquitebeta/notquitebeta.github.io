<p>Chapter 27 ran through an example of creating an iOS app. Chapter 28 ran through an example of creating a Mac App. I could follow the directions but do I really know what I typed?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapters 18-26 /37</p>

<p>I feel like a sieve. Going through these chapters have been a slog and I feel like I’ve forgotten most of what I’ve read already. Ironically, the hardest chapter to wrap my head around was called, “Preventing Memory Leaks.”</p>

<p>There was a good chapter called “Writing Files with NSString and NSData.” This is probably because the benefit of the tool is more obvious.</p>

<p>In the end, like any spoken language, it’s easier to understand when someone else is using it than trying to compose your own use of the language. It’s all part of overcoming the learning curve through practice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aaron Hilligass was on the <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/3/24/027-aaron-hillegass-and-teaching-experts.html">Generation Podcast #027</a>. If you remember, the book I’m currently going through is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321706285/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321706285&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=noqube-20">Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, written by Aaron.</a></p>

<p>I could sympathize with Gabe (a.k.a. <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/">MacDrifter</a>) when he said he had the books for about a year and haven’t made it through them yet. It’s takes time and momentum to get through a programming book. I think that scripting languages have an advantage in this case because you can start doing useful things quickly. With a compiled language, there is a lot of knowledge infrastructure to build before you can start writing something useful.</p>

<p>One useful comment that Aaron made in the interview was how he thought the book(s) should be approached. He said that learning to program should be done in front of a computer. I’ve been reading the book first, sometimes even a few chapters, before sitting in front of the computer. This is mostly because it’s convenient for me to carry the book around and read a few minutes here and there. Having the computer adds a minimum time for each session. I’ll definitely admit, reading separately feels less effective.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapters 12-17 / 37</p>

<p>These 5 chapters jumped from C into Objective-C. They covered objects, messages (which is a term I wasn’t familiar with), NSString and NSArrays, and documentation.</p>

<p>I’m curious to know what NS means. It’s probably something obvious but I haven’t figured it out yet. It has been interesting getting used to the syntax, but it has been easier than trying to understand how to use pointers, so I think that’s a plus. There are conventions in the writing that are very different than what I’m used to in scripting languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby. For example, it seems like there should be a way to simplify:
NSDate *myDate = [[NSDate alloc] init]</p>

<p>You can use a class method like:
NSDate *myDate = [NSDate date]</p>

<p>but again, it seems like that could be simplified. There are probably good reasons for why it’s done, I just don’t know what they are yet.</p>

<p>The one thing that continues to impress me is how fast someone can type using the tab completion. Quite impressive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapters 10-11 / 37</p>

<p>Chapter 10 described structs. It kind of looks like a class in other languages but may not be one. Can’t wait to find out more.</p>

<p>Chapter 11 talks about heaps. I can see how memory allocation and use can be important. I’m not quite sure of the difference between &ndash;> and dot notation in getting values of data in a struct. Again, I can’t wait for this to be explained further in the book.</p>

<p>Chapter 11 is also the last chapter for the C background before Objective-C starts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapters 6-9 / 37</p>

<p>Chapter 6 is about numbers and different types that represent numbers.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 is about loops. After ruby and pythons, for loops in C bring me back to loops in Perl. It always. Seems weird to use semi-colons to separate the initiation ; check; iteration. I’m so used to having the semi-colon represent the end of the statement. Nonetheless, it’s just a matter of getting used to it.</p>

<p>Chapters 8 and 9 are about pointers, addresses, and passing-by-reference. I remember learning about them 20 years ago when I tried C before. I get the idea and realize its more efficient than othet data structures but I don’t get why they are necessary. I’m hoping this is one where using it more will make me appreciate it better. Still, my understanding of them are on shaky ground.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapter 5 / 37</p>

<p>Chapter 5 was about functions. As I was typing, I noticed some things that made me a happy camper. After using Emacs for decades, some of he basic Emacs navigation works as well as ctrl-k/ctrl-y.</p>

<p>The second thing I noticed was auto completion. It was easy to tab to autofill a long function name. It was really nice that tab jumped to the variables and the end of the line for the trailing semi-colon.</p>

<p>Other observations: at least the author uses camelCase for function and variable names. This may be Objective-C convention.</p>

<p>Also, having the ability to add breakpoints is really nice. Will this replace adding print statements to debug? I hope so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapter 2/37
It’s 8 pages. How long can 8 pages take?</p>

<p>It started with an update of XCode…which failed to install. This was followed by clearing diskspace (I was down to 3 GB on my old SSD). Luckily, it was straight forward and did fix the problem. These things happen.</p>

<p>It took a few minutes to figure out the differences in the interface compared to the book. Nothing big but it’s quite impressive how much can change in 2 years.</p>

<p>The actual program took 2 minutes to type and run. All good. Full speed ahead!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapters 3 &amp; 4 / 37</p>

<p>Chapter 3 was nice and short, introducing variables. Mostly, it’s getting the syntax since variables are like variables from other languages.</p>

<p>Chapter 4 introduced if/else statements. There were some syntax elements to remember. For example, the if clause is like:</p>

<p>if (condition1) {
Do this;
} else if (condition2) {
Do this instead;
} else {
Ok, do this;
}</p>

<p>I never remember how else if is used switching between different shells and scripting languages.</p>

<p>Also, it seems like c uses || and &amp;&amp; but not ‘or’ or ‘and’. I’m hoping Xcode with catch those since those mistakes will happen often.</p>

<p>I like that c had ternary operators.</p>

<p>int value = conditional ? value_true : value_false</p>

<p>Also, there wasn’t a programming assignment in chapter 4 which made it easy to read away from the computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Call it having lots of interests, call it attention deficit… actually, you should call it attention deficit. I’m going to deviate into Objective-C for a bit. I have Aaron Hillegass’ Objective-C Programming book. It’s 265 pages and 37 chapters. If I can do 5 chapters a week, it should be doable in 2 months. We’ll see how it goes, and if successful, how much I really know when I’m done.</p>

<p>Let’s do this thing!</p>

<p>P.S. Luckily, the first chapter is called “You and this book” and is only two pages, because I’m already sleepy.</p>
