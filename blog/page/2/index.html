  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick diversion from Rails.  I wanted to make some static web pages with FAQs for different software packages.  There will be a page for each software package and a number of questions and answers will be listed on each page.  This is doable with plain HTML but I&rsquo;d like to try a few new tools.</p>

<p>For the pages, I want to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.  Jekyll uses templating to create static pages.  This is a similar concept as that used in Rails, there you can have a layout and fill in specific parts of the common layout from different sources.  Why not use Rails?  If you don&rsquo;t administer the server, you may not have the ability to run a Rails app.  With static pages, if you have an accessible space for web pages, you are in business.</p>

<p>To get going, I&rsquo;m following Jekyll&rsquo;s <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">Quick-start Guide</a>.  After installing jekyll (<code>gem install jekyll</code>), you make a jekyll directory.  I&rsquo;m not sure why but most of these Ruby-based utilies fail when I use tcsh so, after switching to bash, you create a new project directory(<code>jekyll new FAQs</code>).</p>

<p>Here is the initial directory tree:
<code></p>

<pre>
├── _config.yml
├── _layouts
│   ├── default.html
│   └── post.html
├── _posts
│   └── 2013-06-17-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown
├── css
│   ├── main.css
│   └── syntax.css
└── index.html
</pre>


<p></code></p>

<p>Jekyll is popular for making blogs and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which I use for my blog, is built on top of Jekyll.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>After about an hour and a half, I have the following directory tree:
<code></p>

<pre>
├── _config.yml
├── _includes
│   ├── footer.html
│   ├── header.html
│   └── navigation.html
├── _layouts
│   ├── default.html
│   └── page.html
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── bootstrap-responsive.css
│   │   ├── bootstrap-responsive.min.css
│   │   ├── bootstrap.css
│   │   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   │   └── style.css
│   └── js
│       ├── bootstrap.js
│       ├── bootstrap.min.js
│       └── scripts.js
├── css
│   ├── main.css
│   └── syntax.css
├── index.html
├── software1
│   └── index.html
├── software2
│   └── index.html
└── software3
    └── index.html
</pre>


<p></code></p>

<p>In <code>_includes</code>, I have a header.html that points to the <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> .css and .js files.  The footer.html is a placeholder that just says footer.  navigation.html has a unordered list with home and links to software1-3.  I&rsquo;m hoping to use this for some navigation tabs or something.</p>

<p>In <code>_layouts</code>, I created page.html.  This is the template I use for home and the three software pages.</p>

<p>Assets contains the .css and .js files.  I have not used any of these for formatting the pages yet.</p>

<p>Finally, each of the three software directories contian an index.html file which will contain the questions, answers to the questions, and code examples for the questions.</p>

<p>Right now, everything is incredibly ugly but appears (roughly) functional.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Ruby on Rails tutorial &ndash; Chapter 4-7/11</em></p>

<p>Chapter 4 was a primer on Ruby for Rails development.  Having been using Ruby for almost 2 years, this was the easiest Chapter for me but possibly more intimidating for someone new to it.</p>

<p>Chapter 5 was the start of a <em>huge</em> Chapter and was essentially a fully functional app without using scaffolding.  There were a lot of details but was very well presented.  There were also a lot of other non-Rails development tools presented.  At times, it&rsquo;s not clear whether some tools are used occasionally or frequently.  For example, the impression I get is that RSpec is used often; however, RSpec is not the default test tool.  What about Spork?  I find Spork incredibly useful because it speeds up testing.  Spork was also one of the sources of great frustration because I spent an hour trying to find the source of a failed test, only to luck on a <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Overflow</a> post that suggested someone restart the Spork server because changes in the settings were not incorporated.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 and 7 describes user authentication.  It could have been me but I went through this section without really getting what was going on.  It was a &ldquo;type this and this&rdquo; sort of experience.  Nothing stuck.  Unfortunately, this seems like something that will be needed for most apps.  Maybe if I make it through this book, going back for a second run through will make more sense.  One things that may be tripping me up is that, it seems, the earlier chapters took the approach, &ldquo;Type all this in first and I&rsquo;ll explain it piece by piece.&rdquo;  The last two Chapters started explaining bits of code before any typing occured.  I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s having the context before the explanation or having a chance to think about it before the explanation, but I preferred the earlier approach.</p>

<p>One other problem I still have is the files.  There are some files that make sense like the header and footer being under <code>app/views/layouts/</code>.  That makes sense.  But there are a number of files that are created.  I&rsquo;m not sure if files and directories require specific names to be incorporated into the page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Ruby on Rails tutorial &ndash; Chapter 2-3/11</em></p>

<p>Chapter 2 was fun and short. Chapter 3 was mostly ok.  The page that was built was straightforward enough.  Then, there were more advanced topics like installing PostgreSQL locally for development, then installing Guard and Spork for testing.</p>

<p>Something happened with the PostgreSQL set-up. Installation was easy enough.  There is a link to download a zipped version of the app itself, which can then be dropped into the /Applications folder.  he problem seemed to be in editing the database.yml file to configure it.  Along the way, I messed something up bad enough that my rspec tests were failing with weird errors.  I slowly ran &lsquo;git checkout &mdash; files&rsquo; until I got to a point before the PostgreSQL setup and the Rspec tests were working again.  Then, I carefully tiptoed around the database problem and installed Guard, then Spork.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what they were doing, especcially Guard.  Having Spork running definiely sped up the Rspec tests though.</p>

<p>Installing the Rubytest package into Sublime Text 2 was quite nice as well.  Other than the PostgreSQL debacle and not quite understanding the setup files for Guard and Spork, Chapter 3 was ok.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Ruby on Rails tutorial &ndash; Chapter 1/11</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, I tried to go through the Ruby on Rails Tutorial. I lugged this 500+ page book around for a few weeks and got to Chapter 5 when I got stuck. The previous post was <a href="http://notquitebeta.com/2013/01/27/The_deployment_problem/">here</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, I had been unfamiliar with a lot of other languages like HTML, CSS, etc. It was all very unfamiliar and reading the book was overwhelming because it felt like there was no foundation to build from. Somewhere in chapter 5, I got stuck on a problem that I couldn&rsquo;t fix and that ended things.</p>

<p>This time around, I&rsquo;m going to skip the paper copy of the book and go straight to the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">on-line version</a>.  Although some of my reading this will be on the iPad, some will also be on my laptop. This way, I can work the examples out at the same time I&rsquo;m reading instead of having the book next to the computer.</p>

<p>My goal is to read the book (11 chapters) and deploy a basic version of <a href="http://notquitebeta.com/2013/05/29/Back_on_the_Rails/">Exercise checklist/tracker</a> by the 4th of July weekend.  That&rsquo;s a little over a month from now. I just finished chapter 1. Ten more chapters to go and then the app.</p>

<p>Go, go, go!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After some time playing with Javascript and jQuery, I&rsquo;m thinking of moving back to learning Ruby on Rails.  There are some small WebApps I&rsquo;d like to build.  Here is an exercise tracker.</p>

<h4>App: Exercise Checklist/Tracker</h4>

<ul>
<li>Allow user log in so that it can be used by different people</li>
<li>Add an exercise to the list</li>
<li>have a checkbox for the day</li>
<li>it should reset each day</li>
<li>have a optional memo field for a number</li>
</ul>


<h4>I should learn:</h4>

<ul>
<li>How to authenticate users</li>
<li>leave a cookie?</li>
<li>implement as a responsive design</li>
<li>deploy to &hellip; (heroku?)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Other Ideas</h4>

<ul>
<li>In the full size page, include an inspirational image randomly from Flickr?</li>
<li>Add a bar graph(?) for each exercise vs day</li>
<li>Alternatively, use a calendar and color each day based on % of activities completed (e.g. 0-10%: red, 10-60%:orange, 60-99%: yellow, 100% green)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The family is on vacation this week. Tech gear (and chargers) packed:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>AppleTV</li>
<li>Airport Express</li>
<li>Laptop</li>
</ul>


<p>We knew the house we rented had wifi but did not know about what inputs were available on the TV (yeah, we&rsquo;re addicted).</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realized that wifi was open to the public but had a web-based login. This is one where you can connect to the network but, when you open a page on the browser, you are prompted for a username/password (there must be a name for this type of network). The only problem with this type of setup is that you can&rsquo;t authenticate on devices that do not have browsers. So both the AppleTV and Airport Express were not able to connect.</p>

<p>Luckily, I had a RCA-to-dock cable on my trusty 1st gen iPad. Using this, we were able to connect to Netflix, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the iPad, cable, or TV, but we couldn&rsquo;t get music to stream through the TV (no sound system with connections). The solution was to start the music app and then start the Netflix app. Without choosing something to watch, it displays the Netflix logo on the screen. By pushing video, the music playing in the background of the iPad was sent through the speakers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I&rsquo;m running on my laptop, I wanted to get a remote deployment capability running just in case I wanted to deploy my blog remotely.</p>

   FileUtils.rm("/path/to/file")
  command = "cd /"/path/to/octopress ; bundle exec rake generate; bundle exec rake deploy; cd -"
  system(command)
 end
 sleep 120
end
</code></pre>

<p>It checks for <code>/path/to/file</code> and if the file exists, it deletes the file (so it doesn&rsquo;t keep deploying) and deploys the blog. It then cycles and checks every 2 minutes.</p>

<p>To deploy with Drafts, I have a Dropbox action to create the file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my goals that I had the last few months was to use Twitter Bootstrap. Written by two folks at Twitter Mark Otto(@mdo) and Jacob Thornton (@fat).</p>

<p>Bootstrap does many, many thing. One thing that stood out was the it makes organizing a webpage easier by breaking the page into 12 columns. Then, you can use the span classes to tell it how many columns to use (out of 12 for the full width). But,the reason I wanted to learn it was to be able to make pages that are &ldquo;responsive,&rdquo; which to me means it can display properly on mobile browsers. I&rsquo;m sure these features are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I had a chance to work with a Java jar file. I needed to run a visualization software as a Java applet. I hadn&rsquo;t realize how easy it was to set up.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;applet
    width="640" height="480" 
    code="MoleculeViewerApplet"
    codebase="."
    archive="program.jar"&gt;
    &lt;param name="var1" value="value1"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It did take a while to figure out that the name and value parameters were passed together to the program. The two variables set actually get sent as <code>var1=value1</code> to the executed applet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get this running for a while now but the software was released in 2003 and the applet HTML tag has already been depreciated in HTML5. Still, it was good to know. You never know when some esoteric bit of knowledge could be used.  Also, if I ever need to set up an applet in a web page, I&rsquo;m off to the races.</p>
