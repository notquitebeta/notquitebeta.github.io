    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last two weeks have been spent on trying to learn R, a statistical programming language, Meteor, a javascript-based reactive web app programming language, building the FAQ pages, and a little further exploration of Git.</p>

<p>Learning Meteor was interesting but I found that I didn&rsquo;t know enough javascript to know where javascript ended and Meteor began. I got the book, Learning Meteor, but found that when thing didn&rsquo;t work, I didn&rsquo;t know enough to troubleshoot it.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m at a good stopping point for R, the FAQ, and Git. Meteor really requires further knowledge if Javascript so I think that is what will be where I focus the next few weeks.</p>

<p>If I can get rolling on Rails again, I may be able to do it in parallel with Javascript. It seems like javascript is a fundamental language I need learn with CSS. Then, whether l go with Rails, Meteor, or an iPhone objective-c web app, I have a more solid foundation.</p>
