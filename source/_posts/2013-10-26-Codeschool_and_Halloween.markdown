Codeschool and Halloween

After learning a little javascript, I've still felt a gap in knowledge with basic web programming (e.g. CSS and HTML).  I signed up with Codeschool. I had tried Codecademy and Peepcode before but neither seem to fit what I was looking for. Peepcode is essentially a collection of video tutorials. It tends to be a bit high level and expects that you know what you are looking to learn. Codecademy contains interactive courses. You read a bit of a lesson and work through exercises. Peepcode tends to be passive. Codecamedy is active but has two gaps for me. 1) some exercises just had you read something and click submit. There was no demonstration of understanding. 2) the lessons, though broken into small chunks, required reading the selection. This may work for some but it's like learning from reading a book, and I find that things don't quite stick for me. 

Codeschool is like a merge of the two. Each course consists of a few section. Each section starts with a short video demonstration followed by exercises that are meant to demonstrate some level of understanding. It follows the pattern of first showing you how to do something and then having you repeat something similar on your own. This and having a video (something with sound) tends to engage me better and fit my way of learning. 

I had a chance to learn a bit of CSS and JQuery. I'm not good at either but I have enough proficiency to use them and understand (somewhat) what I'm going. The exposure to the material has been useful and I've already used a little JQuery on some projects I've done at work as well as rewriting the Molecular Weight Calculator app (topic of a future post I'll need  to write). 

I took two weeks off to work on my son's Halloween costume and am eager to get back to coding.  My next course is on Web Programming for Mobile. What's nice about Codeschool is that it's like a survey course for different web tools. Not a deep dive but easy to understand exposure to many things giving you an ideal of what to explore further.
