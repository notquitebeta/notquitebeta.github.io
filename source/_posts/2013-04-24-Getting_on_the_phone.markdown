The first chapter of the iOS Programming book talks about opening a developer’s account. $99 later and it’s done.

The first days after that had me worried that I wasted money. But, spending the money made me look around Apple’s developer pages and that’s where I saw the “Hello world” tutorial.

The tutorial took around an hour and I had my first app on my phone! It just a simple app where you type a name on a box, press a button, and it print out, “Hello [name].”

You’d be surprise how inspiring it is to walk through the procedure. I think it removes the fear and uncertainty of writing an app.

This past Saturday, I wanted to write an app that I could use at work for making a calculation. My goal was to write it in a day. The app calculates the amount of solvent to add to a given amount of a compound of given weight to yield the specified concentration. Also, it has a notepad to record the answer so that other calculations can be made. Then, I can use it as reference in the lab.

I started it when my son started his afternoon nap. It took a few minutes to make the layout in interface builder. Using the Assistant, the fields were linked to the code. The coding for the calculation took a while but was straightforward. Then, it took a while figuring out how I messed up linking the fields to the code. After all that was working, I worked on the notepad section. Finally, I made the icon, which ended up tweaking for hours. I had a functioning prototype by dinnertime. I further tweaked it until 12:30 or so but I did complete a functional app and deploy it to the phone in a day!

Sure, it’s not pretty, but it’s functional and useful.
