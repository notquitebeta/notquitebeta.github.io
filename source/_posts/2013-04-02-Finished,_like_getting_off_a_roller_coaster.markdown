Chapters 29-37 / 37

All of the programming examples and challenges are done (except the one question regarding NSError for the OSX app). Even reading the forum didn’t help clarify that one.

The chapters which walk through writing the iOS and OSX apps were definitely the climax of the story but the advanced Objective-C and C sections were both really useful. Although a logical organization may have been to put the C sections together, followed by Objective C, then finishing with the two example apps, I felt that this organization made more sense in terms of pacing for the book.

My impressions are that I definitely needed a month (including 2 days off of work) to finish this book. I could easily have taken longer since it felt like all of my free time was taken up making it through the book. The length was perfect. Any longer and I would have given up. I couldn’t imagine it getting any shorter than the 265 pages or so (although maybe without the memory management details?). I don’t feel like I can sit down and write anything useful but I feel like I have a 10000 foot view of what I may expect going forward. If I wait 3 weeks without doing more, I think everything will be gone from my head.

That said, next is the 569 page,[iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321821521/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321821521&linkCode=as2&tag=noqube-20) by Joe Conway and Aaron Hillegass. I don’t know if it will be a cover-to-cover read. Hopefully, each section will provide tools that can yield small, useful applications. Otherwise, it will be another 4 months of DVR programming to catch up on.
