I've had the new Macbook Air (2013) with the Haswell CPU for a little over a week now.  My last Macbook Air had a battery that was supposed to last 4.5 hours but practically lasted about 3 hours. Part of that could have been because I was always hitting the limit of the RAM and pages were being cached to disk.  Running the same constellation of apps, I can see that I'm usually using more than the 2GB of built in memory I had.  At times, I've spiked to 4 GB now.

With the new latop, I usually will get over 10 hours of battery life, I think.  It's hard to say because the calculation varies quite a bit.  The battery icon in the menu bar is no longer meaningful becuase it may look like there is 30% left but still have over 4 hours remaining.  Here is a view of the battery status.

For those that may be wondering, this is an [Alfred2](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflow using a [battery workflow](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1211-battery-view-summary-stats-about-your-laptop-battery/) which can be obtained from [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2377432/alfredv2/battery/Battery.alfredworkflow) (Thanks Benzi!).  

The change this brought on is that I'm not always hovering close to my power sourse.  Usually, when I'm working on the couch at night, I am checking my battery status and will have to stop when I get down to less than 10% and I start planning accordingly when I get down to 30%.  Now, the laptop is like an iPad or iPhone where I charge it and just carry it around.  I'll leave it on the dinner table all day while at work without worrying that the battery will be drained when I get home.  I've had it unplugged for days during the work week without a problem, plugging it in when there was still 40% power remaining.  The amazing part is that I can recharge (not fully) in an hour and be good for another day.

It's simply a different way to think about a laptop.
