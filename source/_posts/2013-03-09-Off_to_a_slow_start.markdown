Chapter 2/37
It’s 8 pages. How long can 8 pages take?

It started with an update of XCode…which failed to install. This was followed by clearing diskspace (I was down to 3 GB on my old SSD). Luckily, it was straight forward and did fix the problem. These things happen.

It took a few minutes to figure out the differences in the interface compared to the book. Nothing big but it’s quite impressive how much can change in 2 years.

The actual program took 2 minutes to type and run. All good. Full speed ahead!
