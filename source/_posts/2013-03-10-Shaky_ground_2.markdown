Chapters 10-11 / 37

Chapter 10 described structs. It kind of looks like a class in other languages but may not be one. Can’t wait to find out more.

Chapter 11 talks about heaps. I can see how memory allocation and use can be important. I’m not quite sure of the difference between -> and dot notation in getting values of data in a struct. Again, I can’t wait for this to be explained further in the book.

Chapter 11 is also the last chapter for the C background before Objective-C starts.
