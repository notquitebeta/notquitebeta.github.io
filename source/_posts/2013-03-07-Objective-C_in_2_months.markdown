Call it having lots of interests, call it attention deficit… actually, you should call it attention deficit. I’m going to deviate into Objective-C for a bit. I have Aaron Hillegass’ Objective-C Programming book. It’s 265 pages and 37 chapters. If I can do 5 chapters a week, it should be doable in 2 months. We’ll see how it goes, and if successful, how much I really know when I’m done.

Let’s do this thing!

P.S. Luckily, the first chapter is called “You and this book” and is only two pages, because I’m already sleepy.
