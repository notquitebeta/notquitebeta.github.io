Previously, I had wanted to start learning Meteor.js. I thought it looked like an interesting way to build web apps analogous to Rails, although possibly not as robust because it is not as mature and doesn't have as many Libraries. I went through some tutorials and the book, [Getting Started with Meteor.js JavaScript Framework, by Isaac Strack](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1782160825/?tag=noqube-20).

I follow [meteorjs](http://www.twitter.com/meteorjs) on Twitter, and they often post links to tutorials. I like the tutorials because I could finish one in a night but I felt like I wasn't getting enough of the big picture.   I frequently hear people who learn a computer language by starting with a problem or project they want to solve. For some reason, I never seem to have think of a problem to solve. I usually like to learn as much as I can and then trying to see how I can reimplement a current workflow (reinvent the wheel). I always used to think that I was creative because I could do things others didn't think to do. More and more though, I don't think I have the same creativity that allows people to come up with ideas and then solve them. I think I've always been an incremental thinker; someone who takes a solution and tries to apply it to a slightly different problem. This is why I seem to like going to books more, because I get a whole perspective on the topic. Also, I hope to have a spark of inspiration while reading that says, "maybe this would also work for ..." Most of the time, this doesn't happen. 

While I'm somewhat familiar with HTML and less so with CSS, my Javascript knowledge is non-existent.  I just don't know the syntax. So when something didn't work while following the book or a Meteor tutorial, I was stuck. Short of finding a typo, I wouldn't know how to debug the problem. This is what made me rethink my learning strategy.  I needed to start with a basic familiarity with Javascript. For this, I got the book, [JavaScript 24-Hour Trainer, by Jeremy McPeak](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470647833/?tag=noqube-20).

Now by the title, you would think this could be completed in a single, sleep-deprived day. It actually took 3.5 weeks. By the time I finished the book, I didn't remember the beginning anymore. Luckily, I took notes and even used the photo feature of Evernote to record them for reference. But the important thing is that I have a sense of the syntax now. The other thing I learned was that I don't like how it seems a developer spent unreasonable effort to support IE 8 and below (which is
probably standard in many corporate settings), especially when IE 10 is available. 

Now that I've learned some Javascript, the next steps can be:

- more Javascript (which is probably a good idea).
- Back to Meteor
- maybe some Node.js, which is the server side javascript framework on which Meteor is built. Node has some potential application in that it could be used from the command line in the absence of any web interface. 

Finally, the other interesting stumbling-upon-thingy (there should be a word for this) is [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/), a tool that allows someone to write an app in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and translate it to a mobile platform. 

I'm glad I learned Javascript. I just need to start using it to get it into my head.
