One of my goals that I had the last few months was to use Twitter Bootstrap. Written by two folks at Twitter Mark Otto(@mdo) and Jacob Thornton (@fat).

Bootstrap does many, many thing. One thing that stood out was the it makes organizing a webpage easier by breaking the page into 12 columns. Then, you can use the span classes to tell it how many columns to use (out of 12 for the full width). But,the reason I wanted to learn it was to be able to make pages that are "responsive," which to me means it can display properly on mobile browsers. I'm sure these features are just the tip of the iceberg.
