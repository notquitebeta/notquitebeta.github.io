Last week, there was a lot of news about self-hosted Wordpress Blogs being hacked.  Hey, I use a self-hosted Wordpress Blog and I've posted 26 posts so far.  Sure, no one has read them other than me, but I thought about why I was blogging.  There really were three reasons.

- I wanted it to inspire people to learn new things.
- I wanted a record of what I learned.
- I wanted my son to be have a record of what I did.

Now, the first reason is nice to have but the last two were key.  The last two also required that I was able to keep my blog content.  I have NO IDEA where my Wordpress blog posts live and in what format.  Thus, having a static blog that is also available locally allows me to retain a copy of the posts for posterity.

I'm hoping to migrate my blog to an [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) static blogging platform in the next few days.  It may be ugly for longer than that but I'll have more of a hand in manually crafting it.
