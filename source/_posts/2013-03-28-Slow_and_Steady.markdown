Chapters 18-26 /37

I feel like a sieve. Going through these chapters have been a slog and I feel like I’ve forgotten most of what I’ve read already. Ironically, the hardest chapter to wrap my head around was called, “Preventing Memory Leaks.”

There was a good chapter called “Writing Files with NSString and NSData.” This is probably because the benefit of the tool is more obvious.

In the end, like any spoken language, it’s easier to understand when someone else is using it than trying to compose your own use of the language. It’s all part of overcoming the learning curve through practice.
