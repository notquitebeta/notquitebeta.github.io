When moving to a static blog, I chose to go with [Octopress](http://octopress.org).  It is built on top of Jekyll, a Ruby-based static blogging engine.  On top of Jekyll, it adds the HTML templates, CSS, and Javascript to make it look nice.  I had some doubts when I depoyed it last night but that was because the paths were not set up correctly and, I believe, the things that make it look nice were not connected.  I fixed the settings based on Jon Phenow's blog post, [Deploying Octopress](http://jphenow.com/docs/deploying/), based on the section, "manually configure deployment." All of a sudden, it looked like a blog.

Next up, migrating the Wordpress posts.
