Over the holidays, I started trying to learn Ruby on Rails. I’m using an old O’Reilly book, Learning Rails, published in 2008. It was just sitting on my bookshelf. This is a perfect example of not getting to something. I’m not going to link the book because there is likely a more up-to-date book someone should use.

Like most attempt to learn programming, I read a good bit of the book without ever touching a computer (I never learn). I just was not getting how it worked.

After installing Rails, I went to a web tutorial at [rubyonrails.org](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I think the two methods together are helpful because it’s always hard for me to tell what’s important, but if both mention something, it increases the probability of it being important.

Over the next week, I plan to finish the Blog web app example described on the rubyonrails.org tutorial. Then, I would like to build two apps.

1. A ToDo app
2. A Grocery List app

I’m hoping lighting doesn’t strike twice in the same place. By this, I mean, if I can get the two apps written, no matter how ugly they are, I would have a sense for how Rails works. The next post may be a while.
