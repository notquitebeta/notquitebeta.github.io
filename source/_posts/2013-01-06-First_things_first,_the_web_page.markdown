The last web page I made was in the 90’s. In school, all users are assigned a webpage using the ~ subdirectory. You could just type text into a page called index.html and you’re done.

This time around, I did the following

##Registered a domain name.##

- I used [Hover](http://notquitebeta.com/www.hover.com) to register my website. Hover was chosen because they advertise on some of my favorite podcasts on the [5by5](http://notquitebeta.com/5by5.tv) network. There was a promo code on the [site](http://5by5.tv/partners/hover). I should mention that I am not affiliated with the 5by5 network, I just like their podcasts.

##Found a web hosting site##

- The site is hosted on [Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=nqb). The link for Webfaction is an affiliate link where I get a credit you use it and sign up. You should feel free to go straight to the site if you would like to sign up.
- The reason I chose Webfaction was because it had a lot of installable applications, more specifically Rails and Django, which I have as goals to explore.
- I stumbled on Webfaction reading the [Macdrifter blog](http://www.macdrifter.com/) and it seemed to be well [reviewed](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/05/webfaction-and-pingdom.html). Again, I’m not affiliated with Macdrifter used it’s affiliate link to register because I enjoy the blog and listening to the **Generational** podcast that Gabe hosts.
- This blog runs off the WordPress Application that I got running in a few hours of mucking around.
