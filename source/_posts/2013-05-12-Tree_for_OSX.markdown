One function I always need to manually install when I move to a new computer is tree.  When you run tree, you get a listing of all subdirectories and files within a given directory.

Here is a [link to a nice install for OsX](http://shaunchapman.me/post/329270449/how-to-install-the-tree-command-on-mac-os-x).  I'm putting it here so that I can find the link.  Big thanks for Shaun Chapman.
