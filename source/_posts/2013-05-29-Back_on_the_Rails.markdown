After some time playing with Javascript and jQuery, I'm thinking of moving back to learning Ruby on Rails.  There are some small WebApps I'd like to build.  Here is an exercise tracker.

####App: Exercise Checklist/Tracker###

- Allow user log in so that it can be used by different people
- Add an exercise to the list
- have a checkbox for the day
- it should reset each day
- have a optional memo field for a number

####I should learn:####

- How to authenticate users
- leave a cookie?
- implement as a responsive design
- deploy to ... (heroku?)

####Other Ideas###

- In the full size page, include an inspirational image randomly from Flickr?
- Add a bar graph(?) for each exercise vs day
 - Alternatively, use a calendar and color each day based on % of activities completed (e.g. 0-10%: red, 10-60%:orange, 60-99%: yellow, 100% green)
