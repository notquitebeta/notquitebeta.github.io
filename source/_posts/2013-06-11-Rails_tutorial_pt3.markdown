_Ruby on Rails tutorial - Chapter 4-7/11_

Chapter 4 was a primer on Ruby for Rails development.  Having been using Ruby for almost 2 years, this was the easiest Chapter for me but possibly more intimidating for someone new to it.

Chapter 5 was the start of a *huge* Chapter and was essentially a fully functional app without using scaffolding.  There were a lot of details but was very well presented.  There were also a lot of other non-Rails development tools presented.  At times, it's not clear whether some tools are used occasionally or frequently.  For example, the impression I get is that RSpec is used often; however, RSpec is not the default test tool.  What about Spork?  I find Spork incredibly useful because it speeds up testing.  Spork was also one of the sources of great frustration because I spent an hour trying to find the source of a failed test, only to luck on a [Stack Overflow](http://stackexchange.com/) post that suggested someone restart the Spork server because changes in the settings were not incorporated.

Chapter 6 and 7 describes user authentication.  It could have been me but I went through this section without really getting what was going on.  It was a "type this and this" sort of experience.  Nothing stuck.  Unfortunately, this seems like something that will be needed for most apps.  Maybe if I make it through this book, going back for a second run through will make more sense.  One things that may be tripping me up is that, it seems, the earlier chapters took the approach, "Type all this in first and I'll explain it piece by piece."  The last two Chapters started explaining bits of code before any typing occured.  I'm not sure if it's having the context before the explanation or having a chance to think about it before the explanation, but I preferred the earlier approach.

One other problem I still have is the files.  There are some files that make sense like the header and footer being under <code>app/views/layouts/</code>.  That makes sense.  But there are a number of files that are created.  I'm not sure if files and directories require specific names to be incorporated into the page.
