In this second pass through [Getting Started with Meteor.js JavaScript Framework, by Isaac Strack](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1782160825/?tag=noqube-20), it made a lot more sense.  The first time around, I didn't have enough experience with Javascript.  This made debugging small problems a unbelievably difficult.  This time, finding problems with syntax and misplaced punctuation was a lot easier.  There was one point were I ran into problems and it helped to find someone had completed the project and put it up on Github.  A lot of cutting and pasting eventually solved the problem.

Overall, the book is really good.  The length (about 130 pages) was just right.  Any shorter and I don't believe I would have learned what I wanted to learn.  Any longer and I would have the problem where I forgot the beginning before reaching the end.  It's not meant to make you a Meteor expert in the sense that you understand the underlying theory of fibers and threads, but finishing the book makes you functional to start your own project since you see the whole path ahead.  

Some folks are able to just get a project done using Google and Stack Overflow.  I'm not one of those people.  I need to have a plan in my head for the whole process or it seems too daunting.  Having completed this book and it's included project, I can see the skeleton of a complete project.  This is likely just a psychological crutch but it helps.
