Switching from Wordpress was an easy decision. The question is now how to work blogging into my workflow. Most of my posts have been made using my phone using the Wordpress App. There isn't an Octopress App. 

Since my local Octopress install is on Dropbox, I am using the Drafts App to write and I set up an action to put the message in the posts folder in the Octopress install in my Dropbox folder. 

If the current action works, I would just need to generate the pages and deploy on the site. While these are currently manual, it could be placed on a schedule.  I don't do this because it's sitting on my laptop which isn't always on. If I put this on an always-on system, I would instead probably use a script that looks for new files in the posts folder and automatically triggers a generate and deploy. 

First thing's first, let's see if the Drafts action works.
