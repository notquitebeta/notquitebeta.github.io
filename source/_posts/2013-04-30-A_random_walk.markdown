There is a mathematical term, [Random Walk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), that describes a path made by a sequence of random moves. You can be a normal person (non-math geek) and understand the concept of a random walk by its name.

I think there is a fine line between having (or feeling you have) ADHD and being productive. The difference is what you are able to produce while you are taking a “random walk.” Most of the time, I feel like there are too many things I want to learn. I’ll start working on a project, then move to something else before I get anywhere with the first. If you subscribe to Malcolm Gladwell’s premise that it takes 10000 hours to master a skill, I’ve definitely spent over 10000 hours learning but probably have few things I’ve worked on for more than 1% of it. The difference in someone with mastery isn’t necessarily the work they’ve done but that they put the work into a single task.

I’ve been distracted from working on Objective-C recently. I’ve wanted to go back to Rails after watching a great 2 part screencast on Rails on [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com/). I also received my Hexy the Hexapod from [Arcbotics](http://arcbotics.com/). It was an open source robotics project that I supported on Kickstarter. Finally, my boss got into [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/0) and received an extra unit by accident and gave it to me. It looked like a neat project to try out. It had an advantage over Arduino kits in that it can run a version of Linux with python built in.

All this is to say, I need to refocus after this week and reprioritize projects.
