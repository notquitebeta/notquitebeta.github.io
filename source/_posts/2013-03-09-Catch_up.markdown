Chapters 3 & 4 / 37

Chapter 3 was nice and short, introducing variables. Mostly, it’s getting the syntax since variables are like variables from other languages.

Chapter 4 introduced if/else statements. There were some syntax elements to remember. For example, the if clause is like:

if (condition1) {
Do this;
} else if (condition2) {
Do this instead;
} else {
Ok, do this;
}

I never remember how else if is used switching between different shells and scripting languages.

Also, it seems like c uses || and && but not ‘or’ or ‘and’. I’m hoping Xcode with catch those since those mistakes will happen often.

I like that c had ternary operators.

int value = conditional ? value_true : value_false

Also, there wasn’t a programming assignment in chapter 4 which made it easy to read away from the computer.
