_Ruby on Rails tutorial - Chapter 1/11_

A few months ago, I tried to go through the Ruby on Rails Tutorial. I lugged this 500+ page book around for a few weeks and got to Chapter 5 when I got stuck. The previous post was [here](http://notquitebeta.com/2013/01/27/The_deployment_problem/). 

At the time, I had been unfamiliar with a lot of other languages like HTML, CSS, etc. It was all very unfamiliar and reading the book was overwhelming because it felt like there was no foundation to build from. Somewhere in chapter 5, I got stuck on a problem that I couldn't fix and that ended things. 

This time around, I'm going to skip the paper copy of the book and go straight to the [on-line version](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book).  Although some of my reading this will be on the iPad, some will also be on my laptop. This way, I can work the examples out at the same time I'm reading instead of having the book next to the computer. 

My goal is to read the book (11 chapters) and deploy a basic version of [Exercise checklist/tracker](http://notquitebeta.com/2013/05/29/Back_on_the_Rails/) by the 4th of July weekend.  That's a little over a month from now. I just finished chapter 1. Ten more chapters to go and then the app. 

Go, go, go!
