Aaron Hilligass was on the [Generation Podcast #027](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/3/24/027-aaron-hillegass-and-teaching-experts.html). If you remember, the book I’m currently going through is [Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, written by Aaron.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321706285/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321706285&linkCode=as2&tag=noqube-20)

I could sympathize with Gabe (a.k.a. [MacDrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/)) when he said he had the books for about a year and haven’t made it through them yet. It’s takes time and momentum to get through a programming book. I think that scripting languages have an advantage in this case because you can start doing useful things quickly. With a compiled language, there is a lot of knowledge infrastructure to build before you can start writing something useful.

One useful comment that Aaron made in the interview was how he thought the book(s) should be approached. He said that learning to program should be done in front of a computer. I’ve been reading the book first, sometimes even a few chapters, before sitting in front of the computer. This is mostly because it’s convenient for me to carry the book around and read a few minutes here and there. Having the computer adds a minimum time for each session. I’ll definitely admit, reading separately feels less effective.
