In the last few weeks, I’ve been continuing with [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321832051&linkCode=as2&tag=noqube-20). I’m currently on chapter 5. It’s slow going, but I’m trying to follow along with examples. Not surprisingly, there’s been a few tangents along the way.

The first chapter in the book discussed using [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software). This was nice because I tried to learn Git a few months ago and couldn’t quite get it working. I used the on-line book, [Pro-Git](http://git-scm.com/book), to learn Git but could quite wrap my head around it. Reading about Git in [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321832051&linkCode=as2&tag=noqube-20) helped because it walked through a specific use case that would be applicable to my workflow. This was a good intro to Git that then allowed me to better understand the use cases for Git described in [Pro-Git](http://git-scm.com/book). I’ve found this many times before, where I can’t follow the “basic” reference but need to get an “even more basic” reference. This gives me enough to then understand the “basic” reference.

When I started learned Perl, Ruby, and Python, I would get the Learning {insert-language-here} book from O’Reilly. I never seem to get traction so I would get the shorter book from the PeachPit Quickstart series. A few hours with the PeachPit book would give me a sense of the syntax and general approach to the language (I can’t deny that this reminds me of how I liked picture books as a kid). Then, reading the Learning version of the language allows me to get started. The PeachPit book never seems to give a solid enough foundation to the language (for me) and it would just me a short-term memory version of the language. It’s like getting a few tools but not a toolbox. The Learning series (which is aimed at beginners), is too much and my mind would just start saying “blah, blah, blah” as I read. I’m not sure if it was over my head or I may just be too impatient to sit through the background, foundational basis of the language that is covered in the first chapters.

In this same way, [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321832051&linkCode=as2&tag=noqube-20) gave me a start to Git but didn’t cover all the use cases that I would need. It was gear towards “type this to get this done.” However, this was enough to get me enough understanding to follow along in [Pro-Git](http://git-scm.com/book). In the end, I was able to set up Git repositories for some collaborative projects at work. I’m pretty glad Git was covered in the first chapter and snowballed into getting something productive done.
