Chapters 6-9 / 37

Chapter 6 is about numbers and different types that represent numbers.

Chapter 7 is about loops. After ruby and pythons, for loops in C bring me back to loops in Perl. It always. Seems weird to use semi-colons to separate the initiation ; check; iteration. I’m so used to having the semi-colon represent the end of the statement. Nonetheless, it’s just a matter of getting used to it.

Chapters 8 and 9 are about pointers, addresses, and passing-by-reference. I remember learning about them 20 years ago when I tried C before. I get the idea and realize its more efficient than othet data structures but I don’t get why they are necessary. I’m hoping this is one where using it more will make me appreciate it better. Still, my understanding of them are on shaky ground.
