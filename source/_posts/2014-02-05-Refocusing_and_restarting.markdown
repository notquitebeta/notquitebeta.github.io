Going into the Christmas break, I had grand plans to learn Ruby on Rails again. After a few days of working on Code School's tutorials, I got stalled again. Instead of switching to something else, work started up and I got caught up on work-related reading. Its been about a month and a half and I haven't written any significant code. I've been reading a little bit of Iron Python but haven't coded anything. I did a little bit of Ember.js and read a little on the D3 javascript framework. Again, it seem like a bunch of disconnected reading to learn everything at once but without really getting anything done.

So what's the solution? Let's start with a small project with a defined goal. *The Project* is to write a web app to collect a list of items from users. Then, the users can vote on the importance of each item on the list. One application of this would be to record a list of requirements for something, then have everyone rank their importance. 

My guts would say to write this in Meteor.js but it would be a learning experience to write it in Node and use MongoDB or Redis as a database for users and items. The other goal is to write this within a week. Right now, it's Wednesday night. I'll aim to finish by Sunday night. Go!
