Chapter 5 / 37

Chapter 5 was about functions. As I was typing, I noticed some things that made me a happy camper. After using Emacs for decades, some of he basic Emacs navigation works as well as ctrl-k/ctrl-y.

The second thing I noticed was auto completion. It was easy to tab to autofill a long function name. It was really nice that tab jumped to the variables and the end of the line for the trailing semi-colon.

Other observations: at least the author uses camelCase for function and variable names. This may be Objective-C convention.

Also, having the ability to add breakpoints is really nice. Will this replace adding print statements to debug? I hope so.
